      <h3>METU Computer Center</h3>

      <p>I worked as a Service Manager and Web Developer in METU-CC. I was responsible for improvement, maintenance, upgrading, retirement and renewal of several web-based informatics services. I also developed several web applications for these purposes.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I worked in Informatics Group from December 2011 to December 2013. I had these responsibilities:</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">METU website</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Personal / Department / Administrative unit websites</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>In Informatics Group (IG), my major duty was problem solving. There were a lof of services that the group operates and therefore, there were a lot of problems. Here are the details of the work that I have done in IG.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Survey Service:</strong> I integrated the service with central LDAP service, making the service use the SSO mechanism. I also developed an approval system for Ethical Committee. I developed a very simple METU theme, and developed a secure and automated environment for users. These were for LimeSurvey 1.9x series. I was working for LimeSurvey 2.x upgrade but I wasn't able to finish it due to time limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drupal Work:</strong> IG uses Drupal as a framework for most of the applications they used. I integrated several external applications as Drupal plugins. I implemented Drush in all Drupal installations (single or multi-site). I was involved in porting existing theme to Drupal 7 native structure and did major work by doing heavy PHP coding in the template hooks. I migrated Drupal 6 installations to Drupal 7 having completelely different database structure, as well as transferring custom coded applications to Drupal structure. In conclusion, after 2 years of work, I can do anything with Drupal and Drush. Just ask for it :)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Websites in METU:</strong> IG provides support for personal, departmental and administrative unit websites. This support includes PHP coding, HTML-CSS-JS support, as well as Drupal work. Personal websites can only run HTML and uses tilde (~) in their addresses. I did an experimental application to remove tilde from the addresses, while web server still reads the user account's files (i.e. disabled mod_userdir and implemented a new method using mod_rewrite). Due to management issues, this system was never implemented but at the time of this writing, experimental system was still working. You can check it from
          <a href="http://sites.metu.edu.tr/itosun/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a> and
          <a href="http://www.metu.edu.tr/~itosun" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blog Service:</strong> I received a slow working, an obsolete multi-site Wordpress installation at first. I managed to make that work and respond faster. I added several options to the service, developed user statistics and analysis plugins (mainly for inter-group purposes). I upgraded the service to the latest possible version and implemented single-click update and theme / plugin installation system. I was also involved in development of METU themes for Wordpress and did major work in custom coding, according to the requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic List Service:</strong> In general, I was involved in management of this service. I analyzed the problems, did some server-side security operations and that's all. I know the internals of Mailman and I like it very much.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Development:</strong> I worked for solving problems in CAS and BBS service, and solved several of them but due to management issues, they never got implemented. I also worked in development of
          <a href="http://basin-arsiv.metu.edu.tr">Press Archive Service</a>. I did a lot of small to large development, such as analysis, statistics and automation systems. Many of them are still in use, but I couldn't find time to deploy several additional services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server Management:</strong> I had no root access but I tested all the software in my local virtual machines, and then tell the server admins to install defined packages or compile additional software. I generally sat behind server admins to observe what was going on and when encountered, involve in problems related to my work.
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, I did a lot of assistance in software development, planning and server management topics which are related or affecting my core work.

      <p>I have worked in Information Security Group (ISG) as a representative of of Informatics Group. When I started working in ISG, the group was working on ISO 27001 ISMS certification documentation. I had very limited knowledge before then, I know how to apply verification and validation to the software documents. Every coder thinks that non-automatic testing methods are boring (but necessary) and I took my way to software penetration testing and correction of the findings.</p>
