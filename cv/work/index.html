        My first computer was an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC6128" target="_blank" rel="help">Amstrad CPC6128</a>
        from 1986. Since then, I have been involved with computers. I have done a lot of things, including freelance
        jobs and on-site regular work at <abbr title="Middle East Technical University">METU</abbr>.

      <h3>METU, Computer Center</h3>

      <p>I worked as a research assistant in METU-CC.</p>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading strong">Informatics Group</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I worked in Informatics Group from December 2011 to December 2013. I had responsibilities in web-based development, integration and software development. I had these responsibilities:</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">METU website</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Department/Administrative unit websites (Drupal + Custom coded)</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Survey service (LimeSurvey)</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Blog service (Wordpress)</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Electronic list service (Mailman)</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Software development / management</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Linux server management</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>In Informatics Group (IG), my major duty was problem solving. There were a lof of services that the group ope
        rates and therefore, there were a lot of problems. Here are the details of the work that I have done in IG.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Survey Service:</strong> I integrated the service with central LDAP service, making the service use
          the SSO mechanism. I also developed an approval system for Ethical Committee. I developed a very simple
          METU theme, and developed a secure and automated environment for users. These were for LimeSurvey 1.9x
          series. I was working for LimeSurvey 2.x upgrade but I wasn't able to finish it due to time limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drupal Work:</strong> IG uses Drupal as a framework for most of the applications they used. I integrated several external applications as Drupal plugins. I implemented Drush in all Drupal installations (single or multi-site). I was involved in porting existing theme to Drupal 7 native structure and did major work by doing heavy PHP coding in the template hooks. I migrated Drupal 6 installations to Drupal 7 having completelely different database structure, as well as transferring custom coded applications to Drupal structure. In conclusion, after 2 years of work, I can do anything with Drupal and Drush. Just ask for it :)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blog Service:</strong> I received a slow working, an obsolete multi-site Wordpress installation at
          first. I managed to make that work and respond faster. I added several options to the
          service, developed user statistics and analysis plugins (mainly for inter-group purposes). I upgraded
          the service to the latest possible version and implemented single-click update and theme / plugin
          installation system. I was also involved in development of METU themes for Wordpress and did major work in
          custom coding, according to the requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic List Service:</strong> In general, I was involved in management of this service. I analyzed the problems, did some server-side security operations and that's all. I know the internals of Mailman and I like it very much.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Development:</strong> I worked for solving problems in CAS and BBS service, and solved
          several of them but due to management issues, they never got implemented. I also worked in development of
          <a href="http://basin-arsiv.metu.edu.tr">Press Archive Service</a>. I did a lot of small to large
          development, such as analysis, statistics and automation systems. Many of them are still in use, but I
          couldn't find time to deploy several additional services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server Management:</strong> I had no root access but I tested all the software in my local virtual
          machines, and then tell the server admins to install defined packages or compile additional software. I
          generally sat behind server admins to observe what was going on and when encountered, involve in problems related to my work.
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, I did a lot of assistance in software development, planning and server management topics which are related or affecting my core work.
        </li>

      <p>I have worked in Information Security Group (ISG) as a representative of of Informatics Group. When I
        started working in ISG, the group was working on ISO 27001 ISMS certification documentation. I had very limited
        knowledge before then, I know how to apply verification and validation to the software documents. Every coder
        thinks that non-automatic testing methods are boring (but necessary) and I took my way to software penetration
        testing and correction of the findings.</p>
