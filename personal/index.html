            Humans are social creatures. So I am :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that all humans somehow like reading, listening music, watching TV, going to cinemas or concerts and such activities. These are not hobbies, but needs of human soul. So, I do the things that any human needs to do. The features that makes the life personal is different and unique to each human being. This is my personal list:
          </p>
          <div class="list-group">
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I like playing guitar.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">I have a Washburn X12B (I know, very basic electro guitar) with Seymour Duncan humbuckers (that's good :-)). I have several effects pedals. I have an acoustic guitar, but I don't like to play it. I can also play keyboard, but not that good as playing guitar</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I like charcoal drawing.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">In my spare time, I try to draw fantasy things (like in Forgotten Realms) and human silhouettes with small details.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I like driving cars and I drive them good.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">I also like drag racing, watching and the real racing while sitting in the car.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I love playing <abbr title="Fantasy Role Playing">FRP</abbr> and <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr>.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">However, I haven't played by using pen and paper for a long time.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I love playing computer games, especially old and very old ones.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">I did played several indie games, and I decided that I like the amateur soul in computer games. My favorite genre is action.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Sometimes I write small stories.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">But I am not a really good writer.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">I love reading comic books.</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text small">My favories are the ones created in Italy. I read Marvel too.</p>
          </div>
          <p>When people try to write their hobbies and social interests, they always forget something to write. I do some other things of course, but they are regular ones for me.</p>
